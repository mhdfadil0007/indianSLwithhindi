# 🤟 AI Sign Language Recognition & Translation Platform  
### Full-Stack Web Application with Real-Time Gesture Detection

---

# 📌 1. Project Overview

The **AI Sign Language Recognition & Translation Platform** is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to bridge communication between hearing-impaired individuals and non-sign users.

The system integrates:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision (MediaPipe)
- Machine Learning (SVM Classifier)
- Real-Time Web Integration (Django + JavaScript)

The platform provides two major modules:

1️⃣ **Text → Sign Language Animation**  
2️⃣ **Live Sign Language → Text Detection (Webcam-Based)**  

---

# 🎯 2. Objectives

- Convert English and Hindi text into animated sign language
- Detect live hand gestures using webcam
- Classify static alphabets (A–Z)
- Recognize dynamic word gestures
- Integrate AI directly into a real-time web application
- Provide secure login-based access

# 🔵 MODULE 1 — Text to Sign Animation

## 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step Flow)

```
User Input
     ↓
Django View (POST request)
     ↓
Language Check
     ↓
Translation (if Hindi)
     ↓
Tokenization (NLTK)
     ↓
Lemmatization
     ↓
Stopword Filtering
     ↓
Check if word.mp4 exists
     ↓
Send list of videos to frontend
     ↓
JavaScript plays animations sequentially
```

---

## 🌍 Translation Logic

If the user selects Hindi:

```python
translated_text = translator.translate(text, src="hi", dest="en").text.lower()
```

Symbolically:

```
Hindi Text
    ↓
Google Translator API
    ↓
English Text
```

Why translate to English?

Because animation videos are stored as:

```
how.mp4
are.mp4
you.mp4
```

So all input must be normalized into English for matching.

---

## 🧠 NLP Processing

Libraries Used:
- nltk
- googletrans
- gTTS

Processing includes:
- Tokenization
- POS Tagging
- Custom Lemmatization
- Stopword Filtering
- Protected verb preservation (e.g., "are" is not converted to "be")

Example:

Input:
```
How are you?
```

Processed:
```
["how", "are", "you"]
```

# 🧠 Feature Engineering

MediaPipe provides:

- 21 hand landmarks  
- Each landmark has (x, y, z)

So:

```
21 × 3 = 63 features
```

Instead of using raw image pixels (150,000+ values), we use 63 structured geometric features.

This makes the model:
- Faster
- Lightweight
- More efficient
- Easier to train

---

# 🤖 4. Machine Learning Implementation

## 🔹 Static Alphabet Model

- 63 landmark features
- SVM (RBF kernel)
- StandardScaler preprocessing
- Label encoding
- 80/20 train-test split

### Why SVM?

- Works well for small datasets
- Good for structured numerical data
- Efficient for real-time prediction
- High accuracy for static gestures

---

## 🔹 Word Detection Model

- 12 frames per sample
- 126 features per frame (two hands)
- 1512 total features
- Multi-class SVM classifier

Why multiple frames?

Because words involve motion. A single frame cannot capture movement.

---

# 📊 5. Dataset Creation

Custom dataset recorders were built.

## Static Alphabet Dataset
- 30 samples per letter
- Total ≈ 780 samples
- Saved as X.npy and y.npy

## Word Dataset
- 20 samples per word
- Multi-frame capture
- 1512 features per sample

---


# 🛠 7. Technologies Used

## Backend
- Python
- Django
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Google Translate API
- gTTS

## Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## ML
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- StandardScaler
- LabelEncoder

---

# 📈 8. Accuracy

- Alphabet Model: ~90–95%
- Word Model: ~75–85%

Accuracy depends on:
- Lighting
- Hand stability
- Dataset quality
- Background noise

---

# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (Doubt Clarification Section)

### Q1: Why not use Deep Learning (CNN)?

Deep learning requires:
- Large dataset
- GPU training
- More computation

Since we use structured landmark features (63 values), classical ML like SVM performs efficiently.

---

### Q2: Why not use raw images?

Raw images have thousands of features.

Landmark-based features:
- Reduce dimensionality
- Improve speed
- Improve generalization

---

### Q3: Why StandardScaler?

SVM is distance-based.
Feature scaling ensures all 63 features contribute equally.

---

### Q4: Why multiple frames for words?

Words involve motion.
Static frame cannot capture temporal patterns.

---

### Q5: What are the limitations?

- Sensitive to lighting
- May vary across users
- Not yet sentence-level dynamic detection
- Requires stable hand positioning

---

### Q6: How can this be improved?

- CNN + LSTM deep learning
- Larger dataset
- Multi-user training
- Majority voting for stability
- Cloud deployment

# Changes i made
i changed the versions in requirements.txt to match my python version of 3.12.3
- changed in numpy,opencv,mediapipe,protobuf,tensorflow
- also added scikit-learn in requirements.txt
- i trained the model first by increasing the samples_per_letter to 50 from 30, reduced min_detection_confidence to 0.5 from 0.7, and reduced time.sleep from 0.4 to 0.2(in record_alphabet_static.py folder)
- but it was only showing number 25 in the detected sign instead of a value, even if new signs were shown(in live detection)
- this was because the value was not been converted to alphabet, and the number was straight introduced. and 25 was the letter 'z'
- even when i fixed it, the accuracy was off
- the model was broken, only 3.85 percent accuracy on training data itself
- so i retrained the model again, but the accuracy only pumped to 40 percent
- so i tried data augmentation(which means to add horizontally flipped versions of each sample) and also added probabiity=True for proper confidence scores(on train_alphabets_static.py)
- this increased the accuracy to 90 percent, but still some letters were not accurate
- so i added feature extraction to it and retrained the data again
